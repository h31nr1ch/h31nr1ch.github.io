        <h4><a>Distributed reflection denial-of-service (DRDoS)</a></h4>
        <p> Distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) have been seen on the Internet for nearly 25 years. In these attacks, a set of machines sends traffic to a victim in a coordinated fashion. The volume of data leads to the exhaustion of system and/or network resources at the victim, causing service unavailability and hurting legitimate customers. Distributed reflection denial-of-service (DRDoS) attacks are one kind of DDoS attack in which traffic is bounced off unsuspecting intermediate systems, known as reflectors. DRDoS attacks not only make attribution harder due to an extra layer of indirection, but they also provide traffic amplification, thus making it easier to generate enough traffic to disrupt the target, especially when multiple reflectors are used simultaneously. Moreover, DRDoS attacks can leverage several different protocols, notably UDP-based ones, and there is a large number of vulnerable and/or misconfigured Internet servers that can be used as reflectors. All these benefits to attackers help explain the prevalence of DRDoS traffic on the Internet.

        <h4><a>Honeypots</a></h4>
        <p>
          A honeypot is a computational resource that aims to be probed, attacked or even compromised. Honeypots are extensively monitored to enable the study of attacker's behavior and activities, leading to the discovery of new attacks and how attacks already known in theory are carried out in practice.

        <h4><a>Darknet</a></h4>
        <p>
          Dark Web is a part of the Web not indexed by web search engines, requiring specific software or configurations. The darknets which constitute the dark web include, friend-to-friend/peer-to-peer networks, Tor, Freenet, I2P and others. The The Onion Router (Tor) is an anonymous network that use onion routing and Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is an anonymous network that use I2P router and garlic routing.

        <h4><a>DNS over Encryption</a></h4>
        <p>
          DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a protocol for performing remote Domain Name System (DNS) resolution via the HTTPS protocol, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Using the HTTPS protocol to encrypt the data between the DoH client and the DoH-based DNS resolver, this allow obfuscate the users data.

        <h4><a>Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)</a></h4>
        <p>
          A variation of the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is HIDS, which aims to identify intrusions in an operating system, with a wide application in common hosts but presenting problems with big data and processing time in structures such as data centers. An IDS can perform intrusion detection in two ways, which are: (1) Signature detection consists of using a database with information on threats to be identified and prevented, but is limited due to the need for prior knowledge attacks; and (2) Anomaly detection seeks to define a standard behavior for the system or applications, the inconsistencies (anomalies) representing unexpected behavior or attacks on the system.

        <h4><a>TCP Congestion Control</a></h4>
        <p>
          The Congestion Control Algorithm (ACC) are intended to solve the problem found in the networks due to multiple services and concurrent users to use the same environment. This resources concurrence it's affected directly due to the different number of ACC that exists and that is being used. The most of those algorithms are available in the Linux Kernel structure, and new algorithms have been added during the time, as BBR and QUIC.
          <br>
          The different activities and environments found in the current topologies contribute to the emergence of new ACC, and those are influenced by the amplification type to which they respond. Moreover, some developers, aiming to improve their application communication control, implement a traffic control algorithm over the UDP (as uTP).
          <br>
          Applications as qBittorrent, end up making changes on UDP aiming at minimizing the impact that the protocol has in the network. Thus, this approach avoids the link bottleneck during the data transfer, respecting the heterogeneity of the environment, contributing to others TCP/UDP flows can also maintaining their activities (i.e., avoids the starvation of the others flows).
